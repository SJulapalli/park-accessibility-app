# park-accessibility-app
 
This app is designed to allow parents to search for information about the various parks in their local area and learn more about the facilities provided by each to maintain accessibility. The current build involves wheelchair accessiblity and intellectually-disabled accessibility. Information on running the project is provided at the bottom of this page.

When openning the project, you will be greeted by a blank page with a search bar. You can use this search bar to find and select a location, which will bring you to the Accessibility Information Screen.
